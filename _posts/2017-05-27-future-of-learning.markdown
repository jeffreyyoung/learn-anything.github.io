This project attempts to accelerate the rate at which people learn and gain new knowledge by giving the most efficient path one can take to gain full understanding of any one topic a person may want to learn.

[Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) is the first of its kind, visual search engine for user curated mind maps on the web that is focused on learning in a linear and progressive way. It searches over an open database of connected mind maps.


In essense, the database is a layered mind map or graph of nodes connected with each other with arrows. Each node is a link that leads to a place. This place can be another mind map of nodes or some place on the internet. Where the node leads on the internet is indicated with an appropriate emoji. Each node can have a note that can give some description over what the node means or leads to or what knowledge is required to effectively study what is inside of it.

Visually representing information in this way has tremendous benefits as it allows one to layer information as a tree. Where each branch requires knowledge of its roots. A certain selection of nodes is chosen to represent the main mind map. Each of these nodes acts as a big area of research and is a mind map of its own with more mind maps and links inside it.

Thus if a new person was to arrive to this knowledge map to learn, he can start off at the main mind map. Choose the direction with which he can go and progress his learning in a linear manner. Each node may have a dependency stated as a note. For example if a person was to choose to learn machine learning as a direction he wants to take, it will state that machine learning requires knowledge of linear algebra and statistics. Where both linear algebra and statistics are mind maps and links to them will be provided. Thus there should be no wandering around looking for resources or wondering what one should learn and do next.

Since everyone is able to see what resource is used where and which topic connects to which. Anyone can propose to add a change to the structure of this mind map. Currently this process is done through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/learn-anything/issues) and it is working quite well.

However we want users to be able to create mind maps of their own creation or extend visually the mind maps that we already have.

For that, we are attempting to create a way where a person can edit the source code of any of the mind maps by writing out the structure and content of it. Then an algorithm will take this code and create a visual representation mind map of it which can then be integrated with all the different mind maps in the database.

The end goal is to make this process even simpler by adding 'live edit' functionality to each of the mind map results in the search engine. User can right in the [search engine](https://learn-anything.xyz), press an edit button, move nodes around, add or remove links and then press 'submit button' and a pull request on GitHub will be generated with the changes which can then be reviewed by trusted members of the project.


And in this spirit of open source and open knowledge we can effectively visualise and structure all of world's knowledge and in turn accelerate the rate in which a person learns in ways we could never imagine. ðŸš€

If you want to help us on this journey. You can join our ever growing community of learners on [Slack](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ) and either help with expanding and improving the mind maps or give a hand in creating the first of its kind, [visual search engine](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/learn-anything-search). ðŸ’™
