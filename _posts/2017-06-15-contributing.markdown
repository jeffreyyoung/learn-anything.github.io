We are happy to hear that so many people find value in our search and want to contribute to make it better. Thank you. ðŸ’™

There are many ways in which you can help. But before you do, it is best to read [why we created this search engine and what problems we are trying to solve](https://learn-anything.github.io/future/2017/05/27/future-of-learning.html). You can also join [our Slack group](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ) as that is where all communication regarding this project takes place.

## 1. You can Improve the available mind maps ðŸ—º

All mind maps live on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/learn-anything) and the content of them can be improved. However before adding any changes, please make sure that it follows our Guidelines which you can read by pressing the Contribute button with the ðŸ¦„ in our search engine. 

The reason these guidelines exist is because we want to make sure the mind maps are both of the highest quality in terms of resources but also so that they are not too overwhelming visually. All mind maps should feel familiar so that finding the resource you need is as effortless as possible.

If you do, find anything that is confusing, feel free to reach out to us on [Slack](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ). We are always happy to help.

## 2. You can propose to add new mind maps or change location of current mind maps ðŸ—º

If you want to add a new mind map for some topic that is not covered. You can do this by [creating a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/learn-anything/issues/new) saying what topic you wish was covered and where would it make sense to put it. In future this process too can be made through directly adding new JSON files in the appropriate location in the knowledge graph hierarchy. Once again, please familiarise yourself with our Mind Map Guidelines before contributing.

You can also of course just say what resources and links you wish were added in [our Slack group](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ) itself.

## 3. You can help improve our [Open Source Search Engine](https://github.com/learn-anything/search-engine) for these mind maps ðŸ”Ž

We are trying to make our userâ€™s experience of exploring and finding information in these mind maps as easy and fun as possible.

We have a [Roadmap](https://learn-anything.github.io/2017/06/15/roadmap.html) that states our focus and what goals and tasks we are focusing on right now. 

To meaningfully contribute to this search engine, it is best to familiarise yourself with [Javascript](https://learn-anything.xyz/programming/programming_languages/javascript), [React.js](https://learn-anything.xyz/web_development/javascript_libraries/react) and [Redux](https://learn-anything.xyz/web_development/javascript_libraries/redux).

There is a [list of issues](https://github.com/learn-anything/search-engine/issues) open that you can take a look at. Find what you think is interesting and either say in our [Slack group](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ) that you want to work on ths issue or say it in the issue itself and we can help you with any questions you have.

All development is made on our dev branch and any changes that you will make will have to be merged to this branch. To make any changes, [fork and clone](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [repository](https://github.com/learn-anything/search-engine) and run

```
npm install

npm run
```

And make your changes. ðŸŽŠ

Thank you again for wanting to help out with our vision of liberating knowledge and accelerating learning in this unique way. This can only become great with the help of community.
